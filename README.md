## Snippets for Web Development
Includes ready-to-use HTML, CSS, JS snippets to fasten your front-end coding.

## Snippets for Competitive Programming

Theses snippets are aimed essentialy for competitive programming. We have used a [generator](https://snippet-generator.app/?description=&tabtrigger=&snippet=&mode=vscode) to convert c/c++ code to json file.

## How to include in your editor

### For VS Code
File -> Preferences -> User Snippets -> then select the language.
You have to copy the files and paste in that file (language.json)

you can have multiple snippets in one language by just adding a comma in the end after the parentheses and create your next snippet.
